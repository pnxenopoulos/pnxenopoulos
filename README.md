### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Peter Xenopoulos. I'm a PhD candidate at New York University, where I develop machine learning and visual analytics tools for sports. As an undergraduate, I worked as an analyst for two summers with the [Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies), and then my first summer of grad school I spent building models with [Big League Advance](https://bigleagueadvance.com/). Outside of sports, I've also worked in tech, analyzing investments for [Tuesday VC (formerly Crunchfund)](https://tuesday.vc/), and as a data science intern at Facebook.

#### Projects
##### CSGO demofile parsing in Python
One of my big research interests is analyzing esports, and in particular Counter-Strike, data. I developed the [csgo][https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/csgo] library to parse CSGO demofiles. The project is **active**. 

##### Win probability prediction
Using thousands of CSGO games, I build models to predict which team will win a given round at any point of the round. This is an active area of research for me, and you can read more about it in the following publications:
- [WPA in CSGO][https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01324.pdf]
