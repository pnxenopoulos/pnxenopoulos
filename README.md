### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Peter Xenopoulos. I'm a computer science PhD candidate at New York University. My research focuses on developing machine learning and visual analytics tools for sports, with a particular focus on esports. I've worked with a professional baseball team (the [Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies)), a top seed-stage venture capital fund ([Tuesday VC (formerly Crunchfund)](https://tuesday.vc/)), a sports betting startup ([Big League Advance](https://bigleagueadvance.com/).), and Facebook. 

#### Projects
##### CSGO analytics in Python
One of my big research interests is analyzing esports, and in particular Counter-Strike, data. I developed the [awpy](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy) library to parse, analyze and visualize CSGO demofiles. The project is **active**. 

##### Win probability prediction
Using thousands of CSGO games, I build models to predict which team will win a given round at any point of the round. This is an active area of research for me, and you can read more about it in the following publications:
