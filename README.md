I'm Peter Xenopoulos. I'm a computer science PhD candidate at New York University. My research focuses on developing machine learning and visual analytics solutions for esports, along with techniques for machine learning model analysis. I've worked with a professional baseball team (the [Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies)), a top seed-stage venture capital fund ([Tuesday VC (formerly Crunchfund)](https://tuesday.vc/)), a sports betting startup ([Big League Advance](https://bigleagueadvance.com/).), and Facebook. I maintain the following projects:

- [awpy](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy): a library to parse, analyze and visualize Counter-Strike demofiles. The project has spawned published papers in IEEE Big Data, ACM's WWW conference and IJCAI.
- [ESTA](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/ESTA) A large esports dataset, which contains 8.6m player actions, 7.9m game frames and 417k player trajectories from 1.5k professional CSGO matches.
- [PyCalibrate](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/pycalibrate), a visual analytics tool to analyze model calibration. This work was accepted to IEEE VIS 2022.
- Through a collaboration with Capital One, we developed [GALE](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/gale), a technique to measure the similarity between sets of local explanations. This work was accepted for a spotlight talk at the TAGML workshop at ICML 2022.
