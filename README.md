I'm Peter Xenopoulos. I'm a research scientist at NVIDIA, focusing on developing machine learning and visual analytics solutions for esports & sports. Previously, I led quantitative research for a [sports betting exchange](https://novig.co), worked with a professional baseball team ([Phillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies)), analyzed companies for a top seed-stage venture capital fund ([Tuesday VC](https://tuesday.vc/)), created data and modeling pipelines for an athlete investment fund ([Big League Advance](https://bigleagueadvance.com/)), and worked on the AI data science team at Facebook. I maintain the following projects:

- üë©‚Äçüíª [awpy](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy), a library to parse, analyze and visualize Counter-Strike demofiles. The project has spawned published papers in IEEE Big Data, ACM's WWW conference, and IJCAI.
- üíæ [ESTA](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/ESTA), a large esports dataset, which contains 8.6m player actions, 7.9m game frames and 417k player trajectories from 1.5k professional CSGO matches.
- üìà [PyCalibrate](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/pycalibrate), a visual analytics tool to analyze model calibration. This work was accepted to IEEE VIS 2022.
- üí° [GALE](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/gale), a technique to measure the similarity between sets of local explanations developed in collaboration with Capital One. Accepted for a spotlight talk at the TAGML workshop at ICML 2022.
